# RainFallPredictiction

Thsi notebook tries to answer the question of whether a farmer would need to invest money in irrigation.

The variables we need are `crop`, `month`, `year`, and `region`.

The target variable (our prediction) is simply the avearage amount of rainfall that occurs in the month, given historical rainfall data.

Using this prdition and the crop given we perform hypothesis testing to see whether or not irrigation will be required to grow the crop.
